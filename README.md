# Interview Tracker

This project was created based on a question from StackOverflow where a new developer needed some help. In the end, I decided it would be easier for me to spent a few hours writing a small project for him to show him coding styles, how to do basic queries to pull data from a database and how to display that data to the user. Since it is built to track interview information, I wanted to also integrated sessions and authentication.

### Setup

To set up this project, clone the project to your server. Once cloned, create a database and import the database from `database/database.sql`. Add your database credentials to `config/database.php` and you're all set!

### User Interface

The user interface uses Bootstrap 4.x from getbootstrap.com.
