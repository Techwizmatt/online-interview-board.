# Interview Portal

This project was created based on a question from StackOverflow where a new developer needed some help. In the end, I decided it would be easier for me to spend a few hours writing a small project for him to show him coding styles, how to do basic queries to pull data from a database and how to display that data to the user. Since it is built to track interview information, I wanted to also integrate sessions and authentication.

### Setup

To set this project up in your own environment, clone the project to your server using `git`. Once cloned, create a database and import the database from `database/database.sql`.

Next, move `common/config.php.example` to `common/config.php` and add your database credentials!

### User Interface

The user interface uses Bootstrap 4.x from getbootstrap.com.
